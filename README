This application allows users to signin with Facebook using Omniauth, it then asks the user for their phone number, it sends a text via Twilio with a link to the app, then it attempts to use mobile geolocation to locate the person, and finally drops a pin on a Google map in realtime using Pusher. It was built as a prototype to see what local checkins on a college campus would look like.

The sidebar also lists recent activity and provides "click-to-highlight-user" functionality.
