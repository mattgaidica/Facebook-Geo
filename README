This application allows users to signin with Facebook using Omniauth, it then attempts to read their location from the browser, and drops a pin on a Google map in realtime using Pusher. It was built as a prototype to see what local checkins on a college campus would look like.

The sidebar also lists recent activity and provides "click-to-highlight-user" functionality.
